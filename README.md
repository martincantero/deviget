# deviget minesweeper-API

All the development is based on Magento framework !!! (it's for e-commece business, not for games)

In the first part, the module was created with the base structure and controller logic to test functionality

Then, the part of Api Rest reusing what had been developed.

Finally, the frontend part was added (layout, phtml, css ...)

I prioritized the logic and the api rest, but I could not finish it so that everything works correctly.

Total Time Spend: 5.5 hours (in my free time in two days)
